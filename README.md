## Getting Started

The CLI Jira interface is pretty straightforward. Just run `fjira` in your terminal.

```shell
fjira
```

### Workspaces

Fjira will ask you about Jira API url, and token if you run fjira for the very first time.

![Fjira First Run](demo_first_run.gif)

Fjira workspace is a set of jira configuration data, and it's kept in simple json file under `~/.fjira` directory.
You can switch within multiple workspaces using `fjira workspace` command.

```shell
fjira workspace
```

It will open a fuzzy finder with all available workspaces.
In order to create a new workspace you need to use following command:

```shell
fjira --new-workspace abc
```

You can edit existing workspace using `--edit-workspace` flag.

```shell
fjira --edit-workspace abc
```

### Projects search

The projects search is a default view, just run `fjra` in order to open it.

```shell
fjira
```

### Open Jira project directly from cli

You can open a project directly from cli.

```shell
fjira --project=PROJ
```

The fjira app will skip projects search screen, and it'll go to the next screen with issues search.

### Open Jira issue directly from cli

```shell
fjira PROJ-123
```

The app will skip all the screens, and it'll go to the issue view directly.

## The Future (TODO)

- More docs
- Windows support
- Support Linux packages managers nonsense aka. Snapcraft, Deb, AUR
- More Jira features ;)

#### Motivation

I've created this tool for myself, and the only motivation behind it was laziness (maybe plus fact that I like terminal
tools).
It's really common that from time to time you need to do something like: "I'd just need to move issue 123 to the next
status".
Opening Jira, finding ticket inside the board, opening the Jira issue modal... is okay, but it takes some time.
I found it really handy to do it from terminal, where probably I do something anyway üòù

Sooo, if you feel it the same way as me - I'd love to get some star from you ü§úü§õ
