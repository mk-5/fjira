### Project structure

It's a classic golang project, with organized directories structure.
The most important directory is `internal` - it contains all the source code.
Why internal? because - at least for now - fjira is not intended to be a shared go module. It's just an app that makes
corporate rats (like me) life easier ;)

Internal structure looks like this:

```text
.
├── 📂 app  
│   └── ...
|   📂 fjira 
│   └── ...
|   📂 jira 
│   └── ...
│   └── ...
```

#### app

It contains application engine, so everything that's needed in order to do "the thing" - whatever the thing is 😅.
You can notice that it doesn't contain any unit tests. There is a reason behind that. Just imagine that `app` module is
a vehicle. There is no difference if you achieve your goal with ferrari, or old fiat. This is why it's not tested directly
here, but by another modules that contains business logic.

#### fjira

The heart of application - the main context - business logic of our application.

##### jira

Everything that's related to Jira, and Jira REST API.

##### other packages

Packages should reflect purpose/domain of the package. Packages like `controllers` are fine if you like lasagne in your code 🤞.
Example:

- `views/users_view.go` ⛔️
- `users/view.go` ✅
